# Horn Extras

This feature allows you to bind extras to your airhorn. For example, you could enable a more aggressive/faster pattern , or takedown lights while the horn is in use.

Simply create a stage extra as usual, and assign it in the config.

{% hint style="success" %}
Brake extras are state aware!
{% endhint %}
