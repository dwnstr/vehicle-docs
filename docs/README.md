## GTA5/FiveM Vehicle Documentation!

This wiki is organized by Dawnstar FiveM

Welcome to the new home of our vehicle documentation! We have been growing these documents privately for some time now, and it's about time we make this public to contributions. Feel free to fork our docs and suggest changes!

This documentation is meant to serve as more than an exhaustive list of variables and values. The goal of these documents is to help developers learn and understand the development process with a focus on FiveM, as well as provide best practices and tutorials.

If you're looking for a full record of all variables and values without commentary or best practices, see [the GTAMods Wiki.](https://gtamods.com/wiki/Main\_Page)
